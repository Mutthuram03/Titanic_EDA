Comparative Study of Findings

ðŸ”¹ Key Patterns / Trends

Females had a much higher survival rate compared to males.

First-class passengers had a higher chance of survival than second and third class.

Children (age < 12) had better survival rates compared to adults and elderly.

ðŸ”¹ Insights Gained

Gender and passenger class strongly influenced survival chances.

Wealth (indirectly indicated by class) and social priority (women/children first) were critical survival factors.

Age was also an important factor, highlighting social norms during evacuation.

ðŸ”¹ Rationale Behind Proposed Idea
Based on these insights, a Passenger Safety Prediction System could be developed.

It would use demographic and ticket data (age, gender, class, etc.) to assess survival likelihood in emergencies.

R&D teams can apply these insights to design fairer and safer evacuation strategies for future transport systems (ships, flights, trains).
