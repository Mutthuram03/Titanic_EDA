#  Proposed Research / Innovation Idea  

## Problem / Opportunity  
- Our Titanic dataset analysis showed that **gender, class, and age** had a strong influence on survival.  
- In real-world transport systems (ships, airplanes, trains), **emergency evacuations are often chaotic** and prioritization is not always fair or efficient.  
- This opens up an opportunity: Can we use **data-driven models** to design evacuations that are both **safer** and **fairer**?  

---

## Proposed Idea  
- Develop a **Passenger Safety Prediction & Evacuation Support System**.  
- Train a machine learning model on demographic + travel data (age, gender, class, ticket type, etc.) to **predict survival likelihood** during emergencies.  
- Use these predictions to recommend **optimized evacuation plans** that balance both **safety** (children, elderly) and **fairness** (not just wealth or class).

## How an R&D Team Could Develop It  
- **Data Collection** – Gather data from ships, airlines, and past incident reports.  
- **Model Training** – Use ML models (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest) to estimate survival probabilities.  
- **Simulation Tool** – Build evacuation simulations using real layouts of ships and airplanes.  
- **Integration** – Connect the system to real-time passenger lists and seat maps.  
- **Ethical Design** – Ensure rules prioritize safety + fairness instead of just wealth/class.

## Validation / Testing  
- Run **simulations** on Titanic-like scenarios and compare with historical survival outcomes.  
- Test the system in **synthetic evacuation drills** with volunteers.  
- Compare results against the traditional *“women and children first”* approach to check improvements in fairness and survival rates.
